# Alura Challenge BI

[Alura.com](https://www.alura.com.br/sobre) it’s a Brazilian platform for online technology courses. And since last month (02/22) they challenge some of its students to immerge for four weeks in Business Intelligence projects. The first three week were focus in development and the last week it was reserve to put all the results online.

In this manner, we started this project together with Alura Films, Alura Food and Alura Skimo. For this challenge I used Trello to get the information for each level and Power BI to build a dashboard.

## First week: Alura Films (first level)

### Challege

The first week of the challenge started with Alura Films. They want to analyse what would be the best film cast. So, my job was to help them in this decision building a dashboard/report. 

They provided me with a database in .csv format and my work was to handle this base and make from those data a nice and clear visualization.  


### Development 

I started with a blank .xmlx file and I retrieve the data from the .csv file that Alura Films sent me. In this way I analysed all the data to see what could be useful or not for the company decision making. After a deep understanding of the database, I retrieve the data now direct from Power BI. And I start to build a dashboard.

The dashboard is divided in three tabs. The first is the general information about the films, and then a tab that shows the actors data and the last contains information about the director and IMDB votes.

I focused in three things in this first level: 

 
1. One button/area just for filters, so I could included a good numbers of filter without taking out space that I used only to show the visualization
 
2.	The tooltip, that is a tool used to show more information about a specific data only when you pass your mouse on it

3. Navigation between tabs using button

## Second week: Alura Food (second level)

### Challenge

In the second week I worked with Alura Food. The challenge now was to work with .json format and create a dashboard to understanding how Indian food market was development in India. 

### Development

For this I treat the data (they were split in five others .json files) direct in Power BI query. The challenge was to put all the 5 files together in one table. My Power BI couldn’t put all the files together for some reason that I didn’t find out, and not to take too much of my time I decided create a table with all the data and then exported everything in excel, so I could have one table and then open the excel file in Power BI. After analysing the data I started working with the visualisation. For this week I did a simple dashboard and I explored more the design and the combination of different colors, besides creating the background image in power point and then exporting it into my dashboard to make the report lighter and more customized.

## Third week: Alura Skimo (Third level)

### Challenge

Third week we worked with Alura Skimo, they wanted to understanding how the ice creams sales was going and analysing some specific KPIs as well as a scenario analysis. Now the challenge was working with the .sql format. 

### Development

For this project I worked with MySQL to retrieve the Data Base and then linking my Power BI to the data base so I can start building the last dashboard. 

I didn’t have MySQL program so I download it and I watched some videos and a read some articles to learn how to use it. After this, I was able to create a database and import all the sql. files that Alura Skimo have made available to me. Now my data was ready to be export to Power BI and starting build my last dashboard. 

For this, I created four tabs:

1.	Intro tab, and in this area you can choose how you want to analyse and click then in the specific button (product; clients and employees; scenario analysis)

2.	The second and third tab, I made a new table only for the measures to create some cards with some important KPI, as such as costs, commission, total sales turnover, and profit

3.	The last table was only to making scenario analysis, for this I use the tool “What if” that allow me to create some metrics to see what would happen to profit and total cost when we try to reduce cost by up to 30%
